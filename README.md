# ExTrInOut
#### Description: Expense Tracker

#### Introduction:
ExTrInOut, or Extrinout, is an expense tracker designed for both simplicity and versatility. Unlike many existing tools that emphasize categorization alone, it incorporates an accounts feature that allows users to separate expenses across different contexts. I originally developed the program to manage my own daily spending as well as the organizational costs of hosting a TEDx conference and a Model United Nations. This approach not only makes ExTrInOut suitable for everyday use but also adaptable to more professional or project-based financial tracking.

#### Conclusion:
What sets ExTrInOut apart is its focus on accounts rather than mere categorization. By enabling users to create distinct accounts—for example, daily spending, event budgets, or even parental monitoring of children’s expenses—the program provides greater flexibility and clarity. This deliberate design choice ensures that finances remain organized without being blended into a single pool, ultimately offering a more adaptable and inclusive method of expense management. In this way, ExTrInOut goes beyond conventional expense trackers, addressing diverse financial needs with a practical yet innovative solution.
